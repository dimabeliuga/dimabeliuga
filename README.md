# About me! 👨‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a C++ enthusiast who loves diving into the nitty-gritty of code—whether it's crafting high-performance apps, exploring low-level assembly, or building tools that make the digital world safer. I enjoy solving tough problems and creating projects that are both practical and fun.

## My Projects 🚀

Here’s a peek at some of my favorite creations:

- ### [LogParser](https://github.com/dimabeliuga/logParser)
  
A fast and flexible C++ tool for parsing and filtering log files. It handles single files or entire directories with regex-based filtering, log level selection, and custom exclusion patterns. Built with modularity in mind and backed by solid unit tests, it’s my go-to for taming messy logs.

- ### [SteganoEncrypt](https://github.com/dimabeliuga/Hide-Text-In-Image)

A sneaky C++ app that hides encrypted text in images using AES-256-CBC and LSB steganography. It uses PBKDF2 for secure key derivation and scatters data across images for extra stealth. I’m working on making it faster and more portable across platforms.

- ### [Assembly Playground](https://github.com/dimabeliuga/Assembler-NASM)

A collection of NASM assembly programs where I experiment with low-level coding. From system calls to bit manipulation, this repo is my sandbox for understanding how computers really work under the hood.

- ### [DirectoryWatcher](https://github.com/dimabeliuga/DirectoryWatcher)

A lightweight C program that monitors directories for changes (like file creation, deletion, or renaming) using Linux’s inotify API. It’s simple, efficient, and perfect for keeping an eye on file system activity in real time.

- ### [DesignPatterns](https://github.com/dimabeliuga/DesignPatterns)

A set of small C++ programs showcasing classic design patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer. This repo is my way of exploring clean, reusable code structures that solve real-world problems.

- ### [Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer](https://github.com/dimabeliuga/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer)

A C++ tool that brings sorting algorithms to life using the ncurses library. Watch bubble sort, quicksort, and more in action with a terminal-based visualizer. It’s a fun way to understand how algorithms work behind the scenes.

## My Toolbox 🛠
  
Here’s what I use to build and polish my projects:

- **Editors & IDEs:** Visual Studio Code(+ Vim extension = the best combination), Visual Studio 2022.

- **Build System:** CMake for cross-platform builds.

- **Testing:** Google Test for reliable unit testing.

- **Logging:** spdlog for clean and fast logging.

- **Documentation:** Doxygen for clear project docs.

- **Static Analysis:** cppcheck and valgrind to keep my code clean and safe.

## Interests & Goals 🎯

I’m fascinated by low-level programming, cybersecurity, and building tools that solve real problems. My goal is to create apps that are fast, secure, and genuinely useful. I’m always learning—whether it’s mastering new C++ features, experimenting with assembly, or diving into design patterns.

## In the future, I want to:

- Build more cybersecurity tools to protect users and their data.

- Collaborate with other developers to create open-source projects that inspire and educate.
