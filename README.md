### 🚀 About Me

I first encountered **C++** in school, but I started seriously diving into it just a year ago. I'm fascinated by its complexity and power: high performance, the ability to work directly with hardware, and solving challenging problems efficiently. For me, C++ is not just a language—it's the key to building something truly amazing!

### 🛠️ My Projects

While I don't have a large portfolio yet, I'm particularly proud of these two projects:

- **[Log Parser](https://github.com/yourusername/log-parser)**  
  A flexible log parser with extensive configuration options and support for regular expressions. Perfect for efficient log analysis and filtering!

- **[Steganography Tool](https://github.com/yourusername/steganography-tool)**  
  An innovative tool for hiding messages within images (PNG and BMP). It automatically generates a secure key if you don’t provide one. With just the image and the key, the recipient can decode your hidden message. This project leverages advanced encryption, image processing algorithms, and data encoding techniques.
