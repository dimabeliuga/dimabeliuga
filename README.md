# About Me 👋

Hello there! I'm **Dmytro Beliuha**, a passionate C++ developer who loves the unique blend of complexity and power that C++ offers—its high performance and the ability to work directly with hardware.

## Projects 🚀

While my portfolio is still growing, here are two projects that I consider particularly useful:

- [Log Parser](https://github.com/dimabeliuga/logParser)  
  A flexible log parser featuring extensive configuration options and support for regular expressions. This tool allows for efficient log analysis and filtering.

- [Steganography Tool](https://github.com/dimabeliuga/Hide-Text-In-Image)  
  An innovative application that hides messages within images (supports PNG and BMP formats). If no secure key is provided, the tool automatically generates one. With just the image and key, the recipient can decode your hidden message. This project leverages advanced encryption, image processing algorithms, and data encoding techniques.
